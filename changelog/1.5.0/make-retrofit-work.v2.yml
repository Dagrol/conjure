  description: >
    Generated Retrofit clients now work when the server has a non-empty context-path.
    Previously, a url of `https://localhost/multipass/api` and an endpoint defined as `/me`
    would result in a request to `https://localhost/me`, resulting in a 404. This bug has
    been present since at least 0.45.0.
