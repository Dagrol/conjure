    Defining Conjure YML imports in gradle files is deprecated because it makes
    static analysis of conjure files difficult. It will be removed in a major
    version, please use `experimentalFeature 'GradleExternalImports'` to
    re-enable this in the interim. Reach out to
    `pd-foundry-infrastructure-dev` if you need help finding alternatives.
